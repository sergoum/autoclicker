# autoclicker
I made use of the keyboard and mouse modules to make an autoclicker

Start the program and write 'c', 'l', 'i, 'c', 'k' in order to start clicking.
To stop press 's'

Warning! Watch where you click. If you click in the wrong place, errors may occur. Use with caution.

You will also need to install mouse and keyboard.
You can do that by running:

pip install keyboard

or

python -m pip install keyboard

and

pip install mouse

or

python -m pip install mouse


in a terminal.
